##### Chapter 1 Before Use 

### 1. Important Safety Instructions 

To ensure the safe operation of this scanner, be sure to read the safety warnings and precautions described below. 

##### ❏ Installation Location 

 The performance of this scanner is affected by the environment in which it is installed. Make sure that the location where the scanner is installed meets the following environmental requirements. 

 ●Provide adequate space around the scanner for operation, maintenance, and ventilation. 

 ●Avoid installing the machine in direct sunlight. If this is unavoidable, use curtains to shade the scanner. ●Avoid locations where a considerable amount of dust accumulates. 

 ●Avoid warm or humid locations, such as in the vicinity of a water faucet, water heater, or humidifier, and avoid locations where the fumes from ammonia, paint thinner, or other volatile chemicals may be present. ●Avoid locations that are subject to vibration. ●Avoid exposing the scanner to rapid changes in temperature. If the room in which the scanner is installed is cold but rapidly heated, water droplets (condensation) may form inside the scanner. This may result in a noticeable degradation in scanning quality. The following conditions are recommended for optimal scanning quality: Room temperature: 10 °C to 32.5 °C (50 °F to 90.5 °F) Humidity: 20% to 80% RH ●Avoid installing the scanner near equipment that generates a magnetic field (e.g. speakers, televisions, or radios). 

 At least 15.75"

##### Chapter 1 Before Use 

##### ❏ Power 

 ●Connect only to a power outlet of the rated voltage and power supply frequency (either 120 V, 60 Hz or 220-240 V, 50/60 Hz, depending on your region). ●Do not connect other electrical equipment to the same power outlet to which the scanner is connected. Also, when using an extension cord, make sure that the extension cord is rated for the current requirements of the scanner. ●Never try to disassemble the AC adapter or modify it in any way, as this is extremely dangerous. ●The power cord and AC adapter may become damaged if they are often stepped on or if heavy objects are placed on them. Continued use of a damaged power cord and AC adapter can lead to an accident, such as a fire or electrical shock. ●Do not use the power cord while it is coiled. ●Do not pull directly on the power cord. When disconnecting the power cord, grasp the plug and remove it from the outlet. ●Keep the area around the power plug clear of objects so that the power cord can be disconnected easily in an emergency. ●Use only the AC adapter provided with this scanner. Also, do not use the AC adapter provided with the scanner with any other electrical devices. Model: MG1-5039 

 ●If you have any questions regarding the power supply, contact your local authorized Canon dealer or service representative for further information. 

##### ❏ Moving the Scanner 

 ●When moving the scanner, always hold it with both hands to avoid dropping it. The weight of the scanner unit is approximately 9.92 lbs (4.5 kg). ●Before moving the scanner, make sure the document tray is closed and the interface cable and AC adapter are disconnected. If the scanner is transported with these items connected, the plugs and connectors may be damaged due to excessive force applied to them during movement. 

##### ❏ Handling

■When cleaning the scanner, turn the power OFF and disconnect the power cord from the power supply. 

■Clean the scanner using a slightly dampened cloth which has been well wrung out. Never use alcohol, benzene, paint thinner, or any other flammable substances. 

 ■If the scanner makes strange noises, or gives off, smoke, heat, or strange odors, or the scanner does not function or other abnormalities occur when you use the machine, immediately turn the power OFF, and disconnect the power plug from the power outlet. Then, contact your local authorized Canon dealer or service representative for further information. ■Do not drop the scanner, or subject it to impact or strong shock. Should the scanner ever become damaged, immediately turn the power OFF, and disconnect the power plug from the power outlet. Then, contact your local authorized Canon dealer or service representative to have the unit serviced. ■Before moving the scanner, make sure to turn the power OFF, and disconnect the power plug from the power outlet. 

 CAUTION ■Do not install the scanner on a surface that is unstable or tilted, or in an area subject to excessive vibrations, as this may cause the scanner to fall, resulting in personal injury or damage to the scanner. ■Do not block the ventilation openings. Doing so could cause the scanner to overheat, creating a risk of fire. 


##### Chapter 1 Before Use 

■Never place small metal objects such as staples, paper clips, or jewelry on the scanner. These items may fall into the scanner, and cause a fire or electric shock. Should such objects ever fall inside the scanner, immediately turn the power OFF, and disconnect the power plug from the power outlet. Then, contact your local authorized Canon dealer or service representative to have the unit serviced. 

■Do not install the scanner in a humid or dusty location. Doing so may result in a fire or electric shock. 

■Do not place objects on top of the scanner, as they may tip over and fall, resulting in personal injury. 

■Do not use the scanner with a power supply voltage other than 120/220-240 VAC. Doing so might cause fire or electric shock. 

■When disconnecting the power cord, grasp it firmly by its plug. Do not pull directly on the power cord, as this may damage or expose the cord’s internal wiring, resulting in a fire or electric shock. 

■Leave sufficient space around the power plug so that it can be disconnected easily. If objects are placed around the power plug, you will be unable to disconnect it in an emergency. 

■Do not allow water or flammable substances (alcohol, paint thinner, benzene, etc.) to spill into the scanner, as this may result in a fire or electric shock. 

 ■Turn OFF the power for safety when not using the scanner for a long period of time, such as overnight. Also, turn OFF the power, and disconnect the AC adapter from the scanner and disconnect the power cord from the power outlet for safety when the machine will not be used for an extended period of time, such as during consecutive holidays. ■Do not wear loose clothing or jewelry that may get caught in the scanner while you are using it. This may result in personal injury. Be extra careful of neckties and long hair. If anything becomes caught in the scanner, immediately disconnect the power cord to stop the scanner. ■Be careful when placing paper in the scanner and when removing jammed paper. It is possible to cut your hand on the edge of a sheet of paper. 

##### ❏ Disposal

### 4. Network Environment 

The network environment required to use the ScanFront is described below. To obtain details on your network environment, contact your network administrator. 

##### ❏ Network Environment 

 ●Network Protocol The scanner uses TCP/IP protocol to connect to the network. ●IP Address Assignment The TCP/IP protocol uses one IP address for each device connected to the network. Consult your network administrator to determine the IP address to assign to the scanner. ●DHCP Support The scanner supports DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). A DHCP server provides a network environment in which IP addresses can be obtained automatically from the DHCP server, so there is no need to set an IP address for the scanner. * The number of IP addresses that can be obtained using DHCP is managed by the network administrator. For details, consult your network administrator. ●1000Base-T Support The scanner supports 1000Base-T. However, communication may be slower than the communication speed of the network, depending on the other devices connected to the network and the type of hub. 

 ●SMTP (E-mail) Server The scanner supports an SMTP server, so you can send image files directly from the scanner by e-mail. ●FTP Server Transmission may not be possible depending on firewall settings. ●Fax Scanned images can be sent to specified addresses as fax documents by sending e-mails that include the scanned images as attachments to an Internet fax service. Therefore, you must specify message formats and addresses in the method prescribed by your Internet fax service. ●Printer By using the FTP print function of a printer connected to the same network with the ScanFront, you can print scanned images. 


##### Chapter 1 Before Use 

##### ❏ Directory Service Support 

 ●Active Directory Active Directory is a directory service adopted by Windows 2000, and information registered to Active Directory can be used on other computers. The ScanFront allows user information registered to the domain server registered as the authentication server to be used for authentication to log in to the ScanFront. * A domain server that uses Windows NT Server for the operating system cannot be registered as an authentication server. ●OpenLDAP Server The scanner supports OpenLDAP servers that can be connected to with the LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) protocol. You can authenticate ScanFront users and reference email addresses for registration to the address book using the user information registered on the OpenLDAP server.

### 1. Documents 

The ScanFront can scan documents in a range of sizes from business cards to A4/LTR. It is possible to feed documents of the following sizes and thicknesses depending on the feeding method used. 

##### ❏ Plain Paper 

 Size Width: 1.97" to 8 1/2" (50 mm to 216 mm) Length: 2.13" to 14.02" (54 mm to 356 mm) (up to 120" (3,048 mm) in Long Document mode) Thickness for Page Separation ON 7.2 lb to 57 lb bond (27 g/m2 to 209 g/m2) Thickness for Page Separation OFF 7.2 lb to 68 lb bond (27 g/m2 to 255 g/m2) Loading capacity A4 size or smaller: 60 sheets (21 lb bond (80 g/m2)) Larger than A4 size: 40 sheets (21 lb bond (80 g/m2)) Make sure stacks do not exceed 10 mm in height (including curls) for either of the above. IMPORTANT A document must meet the following criteria to be scannable: 

- When scanning a multipage document, pages must be     grouped together so that they have the same size, thickness,     and weight. Scanning different types of paper at one time can     cause the scanner to jam. 

- Always make sure that the ink on a document is dry before     scanning it. Scanning documents with the ink still wet may soil     the rollers or scanning glass, cause lines or smudges to     appear on images, or dirty other documents. 

- Always clean the rollers or scanning glass after scanning a     document written in pencil. Scanning documents with pencil     written on them may soil the rollers or scanning glass, cause     stripes to appear in images, or dirty other documents. 

- When scanning a two-sided document that is printed on thin     paper, the image on the opposite side of each page may show     through. Adjust the brightness in the scanning conditions     before scanning the document. 

- When scanning thin paper documents, feed errors may occur     depending on the paper type, and the documents may be     scanned and ejected out of order. 

- Laminated documents may not be scanned correctly,     depending on the document. 

- Note that scanning the following types of documents can     cause a paper jam or malfunction. To scan such a document,     scan a photocopy of the document or use an optional carrier     sheet.        Wrinkled or creased        documents Carbon paper 

 Curled documents Coated paper 

 Torn documents Extremely thin, translucent paper 

 Documents with paper clips or staples 

 Documents with excessive paper particles

##### Chapter 3 Handling 

### 2. Preparing the Scanner 

When placing a document in the scanner, pull out the tray extension based on the size of the document and raise the document eject stopper if necessary. After placing the document, change the feed method (i.e., set [Non Separation Feeding Mode] to [ON] or [OFF]) in the ScanFront’s Detailed Settings screen according to the type of document placed. 

##### ❏ Preparing the Document Feed Tray and 

##### Eject Tray 

 Prepare the trays in accordance with the type of document. 

###### 1. Open the document eject tray a. 

###### 2. Open the feed support b. 

 Hint 

- Pull out the center tray extension when output documents are     likely to fall out of the tray. 

- When scanning documents of different size at the same time,     the scanned documents may not collect neatly on the eject     tray. In such cases, scan with the tray extension extended. 


##### Chapter 3 Handling 

##### ❏ Changing the Feed Method 

 Set [Non Separation Feeding Mode] to [ON] or [OFF] in the Detailed Settings screen according to the feed method of the document. OFF When you want to scan multiple documents while separating each sheet one at a time, set [Non Separation Feeding Mode] to [OFF]. ON When you want to scan continuous documents, such as receipts, without separating each sheet or scan documents made of thick paper, set [Non Separation Feeding Mode] to [ON]. 

 IMPORTANT When scanning multiple page documents that are fastened together, such as invoices, place the documents so that the edge that is fastened together is facing down.

##### ❏ Placing a Folded Document 

 Folio Scan enables you to scan documents that are larger than A4/LTR and therefore do not fit in the feeder. (The maximum size is 11" × 17"/A3.) To use the function, fold the document in half lengthwise and place it into the feeder. The ScanFront will scan both sides and combine the scanned images into a single image. 

 IMPORTANT 

- When folding the document, align the right and left sides and     create a sharp, straight fold. Otherwise the document may jam     or the image may not be aligned properly. 

- The fold line itself will not be scanned. Keep this in mind if     there is content such as photos, diagrams, or text that spans     the fold. 

 Loading mark 


##### Chapter 3 Handling 

- For Folio scanning, set [Non Separation Feeding Mode] to     [ON]. Place documents one at a time. 

- Adjust the document guides to fit the width of the document.     Otherwise, the image may scan as skewed or shifted.        **Hint** 

- When placing folded documents, place the document into the     scanner so that the fold is on the right side. The side of the     folded document facing you will become the right side of the     combined image. 

- When scanning a document that is folded in half, set     [Scanning Side] to [Folio]. 

- The maximum size for combined images is A3. When     scanning a folded document of a size other than the standard     formats, set [Page Size] to [Auto size]. 

- When scanning a document that is folded in half, set     [Resolution (dpi)] to 300 dpi or less. 

- When scanning a document that is folded in half, the [Double     feed detection by Ultrasonic] function cannot be used. 

##### ❏ Placing a Long Document 

 You scan documents up to 120" (3048 mm) in length. IMPORTANT 

- When scanning a long document, set [Page Size] to [Auto size     (Long)]. 

- When scanning a long document, set [Resolution (dpi)] to 200     dpi or less. 

- You cannot set [Scanning Side] to [Folio] when scanning a     long document. 

##### ❏ Placing a Card 

 When you want to scan a card, follow the procedure below to place the card. 

###### 1. Set [Non Separation Feeding Mode] to [ON]. 

###### 2. Adjust the document guides to match the width of the 

 card. 

###### 3. Place the card face down with the top edge at the 

 bottom of the tray. 


##### Chapter 3 Handling 

 CAUTION 

- Place the cards one at a time. 

- When scanning cards, place them to be fed horizontally. If you     place cards to be fed vertically, they may not be ejected     properly, and cards that get jammed may be damaged when     you remove them. 

- When scanning cards, set [Double feed detection by     Ultrasonic] to [OFF] in the Detailed Settings screen. (See     p. 89.) 

- Pull the lock lever and open the panel unit before removing a     placed card. Inserting a finger into the scanner while the panel     unit is closed may result in an injury. 

**Hint** When scanning cards without embossing, up to 10 cards can be placed on the scanner at the same time. In such cases, set [Document type] to [Extra-thick paper/plastic card] in the Detailed Settings screen. (See p. 94.) 

##### ❏ Placing a Carrier Sheet 

 When scanning a document that requires extra protection from damage, insert the document into an optional carrier sheet before placing it in the scanner. 

###### 1. Set [Document type] to [Carrier sheet] in the Detailed 

 Settings screen. (See p. 94.) 

###### 2. Insert the document into the carrier sheet. 

###### 3. Load the document with the page you want to scan 

 facing down. After placing the document, align the document guides with both edges of the document. CAUTION 

- If the carrier sheet or passport is not loaded properly, you may     get a document jam or not get a scan image as intended 

- When [Carrier sheet] is selected, [Double feed detection by     Ultrasonic] will be set to [OFF] automatically.        **IMPORTANT** 

- Insert documents straight into the center of the carrier sheet.     Proper scanning will not be possible if the document is too     close to either side, tilted, or protruding from the carrier sheet. 

 Lock lever 


##### Chapter 3 Handling 

- The maximum thickness that can be scanned is 33.53 lb bond     (0.00591" (127 g/m2 (0.15 mm))). If the thickness exceeds     33.53 lb bond (0.00591" (127 g/m2 (0.15 mm))), the scanner     may break down due to problems such as paper jam. 

- Depending on the condition of the carrier sheet, the scanned     image may be cut off and the scanner’s correction functions     may not operate properly. In such cases, specify a larger     paper size (e.g., A4) in the [Page Size] setting. 

- The carrier sheet is a consumable item. Replace it as     necessary, if there are visible scratches or smudges, for     example. The general replacement cycle for the carrier sheet     is about 1,000 scans involving a single sheet of 21 lb bond     (80 g/m2) paper per scan. 

##### ❏ Placing a Carrier Sheet for Passports 

 When scanning a passport, insert the passport into an optional carrier sheet for passports before placing it in the scanner. 

###### 1. Set [Document type] to [Carrier sheet (passport 

 type)] in the Detailed Settings screen. (See p. 94.) 

###### 2. Open the page of the passport that you want to scan. 

 Insert the passport into the carrier sheet so that the thicker side is positioned as close as possible to the sealed end. 

###### 3. Load the document with the sealed end of the carrier 

 sheet as the leading edge and the page you want to scan facing down. Adjust the document guides on both sides of the document after placing the document. CAUTION 

- If the carrier sheet and passport are not placed properly, paper     jams may occur or the document may not be scanned     properly. 


##### Chapter 3 Handling 

- When [Carrier sheet (passport type)] is selected, [Double feed     detection by Ultrasonic] will be set to [OFF] automatically.        **IMPORTANT** 

- Depending on the condition of the carrier sheet or passport,     the scanned image may be cut off and the scanner’s     correction functions may not operate properly. In such cases,     specify a larger paper size (e.g., A4) in the [Page Size] setting.     (See p. 86.) 

- If the size of the passport is significantly different from the size     of the carrier sheet, document jamming may occur and the     scanner’s correction functions may not operate properly. 

- The thickness limit for scannable documents is 0.236" (6 mm)     with the passport inserted in the carrier sheet. If 0.236" (6 mm)     is exceeded, document jamming may occur and the scanner     may be damaged. 

- Documents other than passports should not be inserted into     the carrier sheet and scanned. This may cause the scanner to     break down. 

- The carrier sheet is a consumable item. Replace it as     necessary, if there are visible scratches or smudges, for     example. 


##### Chapter 3 Handling 

### 4. Clearing a Paper Jam or Double Feed Error 

When a paper jam or double feed error is detected, feeding and scanning stops. 

###### 1. Check the displayed message. 

 If a paper jam or double feed error is detected at the first page of a document, the following messages appear. 

 Hint 

- If you press [Complete], the display returns to the previous     screen. 

- If you want to continue scanning, reset the document before     progressing with screen operations. Press [Continue] to     resume scanning. 

 If a paper jam or double feed error is detected in the middle of a document, the following messages appear. 


##### Chapter 3 Handling 

 Hint 

- If you want to continue scanning, clear the document first     before touching the screen. After you reset the cleared     document, press [Continue] to resume scanning. 

- To re-scan the document from the previewed page, set the     document in the scanner, starting with the page displayed in     the preview, and press [DISCARD & CONTINUE]. 

- To save the previewed image as a scanned image and then     scan the remaining documents, set the remaining documents     in the scanner and press [SAVE & CONTINUE]. 

- If you press [Complete], the scanned images up until the     paper jam or double feed error are saved and scanning     completes. The display switches to the Send screen. 

- If you press [Cancel], the scanned images are canceled, and     the display returns to the previous screen.        **IMPORTANT** When the message above is displayed and the scanner transitions to Low Power Mode, all of the data scanned up until that point is discarded. (See “Adjust the wait time until the Low Power Mode.” on p. 152.) 

###### 2. Remove the scanned documents from the document 

 eject tray, and any documents remaining in the document feed tray. 

###### 3. Pull the lock lever toward you and then fully open the 

 panel unit.

 Lock lever 


##### Chapter 3 Handling 

###### 5. Close the panel unit and then place the document 

 again. 

###### 6. Press [Continue] to resume scanning. 

 IMPORTANT 

- If paper jams or double feed errors occur, set [Document type]     to [Extra-thin paper] in the Detailed Settings screen. In     addition, limit the number of documents placed on the scanner     to about 10 sheets. 

- A dirty or worn feed roller, or documents stuck together as a     result of static electricity are common causes of paper jams or     double feed errors.     If the feed roller is dirty, clean it. If paper jams or double feed     errors continue to occur even after cleaning, purchase an     Exchange Roller Kit and replace the rollers (feed roller and     retard roller). (See p. 184.)
