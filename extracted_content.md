❏ Take care not to spill liquid on the product.


❏ Do not use aerosol products that contain flammable gases inside or around this 
product. Doing so may cause fire.


❏ Always turn the product off using the P power button. When this button is pressed, the

❏ Leave the ink cartridges installed. Removing the cartridges can dry out the print head 
and may prevent the product from printing.


❏ Be careful not to trap your fingers when closing the disc cover.


❏ The product uses galvanized sheet metal, and this may cause rusting at the edges; 
however, this does not cause any harm to the function of the product.


❏ Do not place any drink or liquid on the product as penetration by liquid inside the

# Page 10

❏ Be careful when you handle used ink cartridges, as there may be some ink remaining 
around the ink supply port. If ink gets on your skin, wash the area thoroughly with soap 
and water. If ink gets into your eyes, flush them immediately with water. If discomfort or 
vision problems remain after a thorough flushing, see a doctor immediately.


❏ Do not remove or tear the label on the cartridge; this can cause leakage.


❏ Install the ink cartridge immediately after you remove it from its package. If you leave a 
cartridge unpacked for a long time before using it, normal printing may not be possible.


❏ Use the ink cartridge before the expiration date printed on its package.


❏ Do not dismantle ink cartridges or try to refill them. This could damage the print head.


❏ After bringing an ink cartridge inside from a cold storage site, allow it to warm up at 
room temperature for at least three hours before using it.


❏ Store ink cartridges in a cool, dark place.


❏ Do not touch the green IC chip on the side of the cartridge. Doing so may prevent 
normal operation and printing.


❏ The IC chip on this ink cartridge retains a variety of cartridge-related information, such 
as the ink cartridge status, so that the cartridge may be removed and reinserted freely. 
However, each time the cartridge is inserted, some ink is consumed because the 
product automatically performs a reliability check.


❏ Do not place ink cartridges with the ink supply area facing down. This may result in ink 
leakage. Also, dirt attached to the ink supply area may result in the product not 
functioning properly.

This mode uses stacker 1 and 2 as the input stackers, and stacker 3 or 4 as the output 
stacker.


Different types of discs (CD and DVD) can be loaded into each of the 2 stackers and can 
create different types of discs. This is ideal for creating small batches of discs at once.


If the same type of discs are loaded into stacker 1 and 2 and Auto is selected for the input 
stacker setting, up to 100 CDs/DVDs can be continuously published by taking out 
published discs without refilling discs.


Up to 1000 CDs/DVDs can be continuously published in a single job by refilling discs and 
taking out published discs.


If stacker 4 is selected as the output stacker, discs can be removed without stopping the 
product while running a job.


Note:
This mode does not use stacker 3 if you select stacker 4 as the output stacker.


& See “External Output Mode” on page 44.


Batch Mode


This mode uses stacker 1 and 2 as the input stackers, and stacker 2 and 3 as the output 
stackers.

Notice for CD/DVD Writing and Printing


❏ Store the stacker out of direct sunlight. A warped or damaged stacker may stop the 
product from operating normally.


❏ Use only CDs/DVDs labeled as suitable for printing, for example “Printable on the label 
surface” or “Printable with ink jet printers.”


❏ For more details on handling CDs/DVDs and for guidelines for writing data to 
CDs/DVDs, refer to your CD/DVD documentation.


❏ When using the product for the first time after storing it for a long time or after an error, 
missing dots or ink stains may appears and print quality may be reduced. If publishing 
a large number of discs, check print quality by publishing one disc in advance. If any 
dots are missing, run head cleaning.


❏ When writing and printing discs separately, it is recommended to print after writing. If 
you write discs after printing, ink may cause discs to stick to each other and result in a 
transport error, or dirt, stains, or scratches on the disc may cause a write error. 


❏ Printing on rib area may result in ink sticking, disc sticking, or color loss.


❏ Try to test print on a spare CD/DVD, and check the printed surface after waiting for one 
full day, especially before printing a large number of CDs/DVDs.


❏ After printing the first copy, check the print quality to see if any dots are missing.

❏ Before using or touching the printed surface of your CDs/DVDs, make sure they are 
completely dry and keep them out of direct sunlight.


❏ If the printed surface is sticky even after it has dried, do the following.
1. Change label type.
2. Change color saturation level.
3. Change the disc.


❏ Moisture on the printable surface may cause smearing.


❏ If you print on the matte label type of Epson specified discs, set Label Type to CD/DVD 
Premium Label.


❏ When using Epson specified discs, only [1] can be selected for Print Mode setting.


❏ Reprinting on the same disc may not improve the print quality.


❏ Be sure to clean the inside of the stacker before using if there is any dirt.


❏ Please check disc before printing, as the size of the receptor may vary.


❏ Ink may not bond if printed outside the receptor.


❏ If the product is operating, wait for 10 seconds after the operation is finished, and then 
turn the power off.


❏ Data may be lost depending on the disc or storing condition; therefore, store important 
data on multiple discs. Epson does not guarantee the data against loss.


❏ Do not insert a disc between DVD drive 1 and DVD drive 2, as you may not be able to 
remove it.


❏ Do not insert an object like a screwdriver or clip into the CD/DVD slots as this may 
cause a malfunction.


❏ A published CD/DVD may not be readable on another type of drive or player due to 
compatibility.


❏ The quality of the blank disc determines print and write quality. It is recommended to 
use only the specified disc type.


❏ It is recommended that you run a compare while writing data.


❏ Making a backup is recommended if the data is important. Recorded data may degrade 
over long storing periods. It is recommended to make backups periodically.


❏ Do not shock or vibrate the product while reading or writing, as this may result in 
malfunction of the drive or make the disc unusable.

Precautions for Duplicating CDs/DVDs


❏ Please use a CD/DVD drive that supports MMC 4.0-compatible commands and 
operates in conformity with MMC 4.0 as a source drive for copying. (Please check the 
Epson website for a list of drives for which operation has been verified.)


❏ Copying CDs/DVDs may not be possible depending on the type of CD/DVD source 
drive used. If problems occur, please try using a different CD/DVD source drive for 
copying.


Publishing Discs

# Page 30

❏ To copy from the drive using EPSON Total DIsc Maker, please log onto Windows as a 
user with administrator privileges (belonging to the administrator group). Otherwise, 
copying is not possible, because certain parts of the drive cannot be accessed with a 
limited user account. 


❏ If the source disc is a multi-session CD/DVD, it cannot be copied.


❏ If the source disc is a packet-written CD, it cannot be copied.


Printing on CDs/DVDs with a Commercially Available Software 
Package


When you print on CDs/DVDs with a commercially available software package that 
supports CD/DVD printing, you have to make the following settings.


Size
124 x 124 mm (4.88 x 4.88")


Type
CD/DVD Label, CD/DVD Premium Label, or Epson 
Specified CD/DVD Label


Margins on all sides
2 mm (0.08")


Notice for Barcode Printing


❏ When printing barcodes and 2D codes, be sure to use Epson brand ink cartridges.


❏ When printing barcodes and 2D codes on discs that are not Epson specified discs, 
check whether the printed barcodes or 2D codes can be read correctly by a scanner.


❏ Do not place barcodes or 2D codes where they overlap other print data, or where they 
extend beyond the print area.


❏ Barcodes and 2D codes use the ratio of black to white to indicate information. If ink 
penetration results in a deterioration of the ratio of black to white, barcodes and 2D 
codes may not be able to be read correctly. Check whether the printed barcodes and 
2D codes can be read correctly by a scanner.


❏ If a barcode printed with bidirectional printing cannot be read correctly, align the print 
head and then print the barcode, or print the barcode with unidirectional printing.

the same as the number of discs loaded into stacker 2. Also, the number of discs does not 
always become 50. The same applies to the number of discs output to stacker 2. For Batch 
mode, the output stacker switches to stacker 2 when the ejected discs accumulated in stacker 
3 reach the height limit. As a result, the number of discs output to the stacker depends on the 
thickness of the discs used.

Replacing Ink Cartridges


Checking the Ink Cartridge Status


Note:
❏
Epson cannot guarantee the quality or reliability of ink not made by EPSON.


❏
When an ink cartridge is running low, the status is displayed on the EPSON Total Disc Monitor.


To check the ink cartridge status, do the following:


❏ EPSON Total Disc Monitor appears automatically when you start a job. You can check 
the ink cartridge status from this window.
You can also run EPSON Total Disc Monitor from the Start menu.
& See “Using EPSON Total Disc Monitor” on page 100.


![Image](img/img78_1.png)

Note:
If any of the ink cartridges installed in the product is broken, incompatible with the product 
model, or improperly installed, EPSON Total Disc Monitor will not display an accurate 
calculation of the ink cartridge status. Be sure to replace or reinstall any such ink cartridge with 
an ink cartridge supported by the product.

Precautions on Ink Cartridge Replacement


Read all the instructions in this section before replacing the ink cartridges.


❏ Install all six ink cartridges. Disc publishing (write/print) cannot be done if even only one 
ink cartridge is missing.


❏ This product uses ink cartridges equipped with an IC chip that monitors the amount of 
ink used by each cartridge. Cartridges are usable even if they are removed and 
reinserted. However, some ink is consumed each time cartridges are inserted, because 
the product automatically checks their reliability.


❏ The valve in the ink supply port is designed to contain any excess ink that may be 
released. However, careful handling is recommended. Do not touch the supply port of 
the ink cartridge or its surrounding area.


❏ Ink is consumed during the following operations: ink charging when an ink cartridge is 
installed, print head cleaning, and automatic cleaning executed periodically.


❏ For maximum ink efficiency, only remove an ink cartridge when you are ready to 
replace it. Ink cartridges with low ink status may not be used when reinserted.


❏ Do not refill the ink cartridges. Other products not manufactured by Epson may cause 
damage that is not covered by Epson's warranties, and under certain circumstances, 
may cause erratic product behavior.


❏ Keep ink cartridges out of the reach of children. Do not allow children to drink from or 
handle the cartridges.


❏ Be careful when you handle used ink cartridges, as there may be some ink around the 
ink supply port. If ink gets on your skin, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water. 
If ink gets into your eyes, flush them immediately with water. If discomfort or vision 
problems continue after a thorough flushing, see a doctor immediately.


❏ Epson recommends the use of genuine Epson ink cartridges. The use of non-genuine 
ink may cause damage that is not covered by Epson's warranties, and under certain 
circumstances, may cause erratic product behavior.


❏ Do not open the ink cartridge package until you are ready to install it in the product.


❏ Use ink cartridges within six months after opening the packages.


❏ Leave the old cartridge installed in the product until you have obtained a replacement; 
otherwise, ink remaining in the print head nozzles may dry out.


Replacing Ink Cartridges
79

# Page 80

❏ You cannot continue printing with an ink cartridge after it has reached its replacement 
time, even if the other cartridges still contain ink. Before printing, replace the used 
cartridge.


❏ Do not turn off the product or open the ink cartridge cover while loading ink (Power light 
is flashing). Opening of covers may cause the ink to reload, resulting in more of the ink 
being consumed. Also, normal printing may be disturbed.


❏ If the ink cartridge is not recognized even if it is correctly installed, dirt may be attached 
to the green circuit board. Remove the cartridge, wipe the circuit board with a soft cloth 
and install it again.


❏ Color adjustment of the product is based on the use of genuine Epson ink cartridges. 
Use of non-genuine ink cartridges may result in reduced print quality and the product 
performance may not be optimum.


❏ When the Ink lamp is flashing or lit, the ink cartridge is not correctly installed. Check that 
it is installed correctly.


❏ If installing an ink cartridge does not provide normal printing, press the Cleaning button 
for 3 seconds. If it does not resolve the problem, repeat the process for 1 or 2 times.


❏ By turning off the product using the Power button, print head is automatically covered 
to prevent ink from drying. When not in use after installing ink cartridges, make sure to 
turn off using the Power button. Do not unplug the power cord or shut down the breaker 
while the power is on.


❏ When moving or transporting the product after installing ink cartridges, move or 
transport with ink cartridges installed.


Replacing an Ink Cartridge


Note:
❏
Do not open the ink cartridge package until you are ready to install it in the product.


❏
To confirm the status of each ink cartridge, see the following section:

If any segment of the printed lines is missing, as shown below, this could mean a 
clogged ink nozzle.


& See “Cleaning the Print Head” on page 85.


Cleaning the Print Head


If you find that the printout is unexpectedly faint or that dots are missing, you may be able 
to solve these problems by cleaning the print head, which ensures that the nozzles are 
delivering ink properly.


You can clean the print head from your computer using the head cleaning utility in the 
printer driver or from the product by using the buttons.
c
Caution:
❏
Do not open the ink cartridge cover while cleaning print head. Print head cleaning stops

is incorrect or missing.


❏
Use the nozzle check utility first to confirm that the print head needs to be cleaned. This saves 
ink.


❏
When ink is low you may not be able to clean the print head. When ink has reached its 
replacement time, you cannot clean the print head. Replace the appropriate ink cartridge first.

Disc or the Disc Tray Does Not Feed Correctly


Disc Does Not Feed


Remove the stack of discs and make sure of the following:


❏ The disc is not damaged.


❏ The disc is not too old. See the instructions that came with the disc for more 
information.


❏ The discs are not loaded above the red line in the stacker.


❏ Discs may have stuck together because of incorrect transportation of the discs; 
therefore, discs should be separated thoroughly before loading into the stacker. Also, 
storing discs in the stacker for an extended period of time may cause discs to stick to 
each other again. If discs are stored in the stacker for an extended period of time, 
separate the discs again before operating the product.


❏ A disc is not jammed inside the product. If it is, remove the jammed disc.
& See “Disc Jams” on page 103.


❏ The ink cartridges have not reached replacement time. If a cartridge has reached its 
replacement time, replace it.
& See “Replacing an Ink Cartridge” on page 80.


If a disc does not feed from the input stacker:


1. Open the disc cover.
2. Remove blank discs from the stacker.
3. Fan a stack of discs to prevent them from sticking together. 
4. Insert discs back in the stacker.
5. Close the disc cover.
6. Publish disc again.


If a disc does not feed from the drive tray or the printer tray:


1. Turn the power off.
2. Turn the power back on.
3. Publish disc again.


If the arm has picked up a disc:


Do not remove the disc by hand, as the arm may be damaged. To remove the disc, turn off 
the power and turn on the power again, and let the initializing process remove the disc.

❏ Make sure none of the discs are damaged.


❏ Remove the stack of discs and make sure the discs are not too thin.
& See “Discs” on page 119.


❏ Remove discs from the stacker and fan them before loading them back.


❏ If only one disc is found when multiple feed error is displayed, disc thickness or 
warpage maybe out of standard. Follow the steps below to resolve the multiple disc 
feed error and replace discs. If the same error continues to occur, contact your dealer.


1. Open disc cover.
2. Remove the disc from the tray.
3. Remove discs from the input stacker.
4. Insert other discs into the input stacker.
5. Close the disc cover and the job will resume.


Disc Jams


If a disc is left in the drive or printer tray, it will be ejected when you turn off/on the product. 
If you cannot remove the disc by restarting the product, follow the procedures below:


❏ If a disc is stuck in the printer tray, turn off the product, unplug the power cable from the 
wall outlet, and open the disc cover located on the rear of the product. Then remove all 
the discs inside. Close the disc cover. After removing the discs, clean the printer tray.


❏ If a disc is stuck in the drive tray, turn off the product, unplug the power cable from the 
wall outlet, and then insert a pin into the eject hole to open the tray forcibly. Then, 
remove the disc from the tray and close it.


Note:
Insert a pin into the hole and push to eject the tray when the tray doesn’t unload by pressing the 
Eject button. In normal operation, the eject button should be used to unload the tray. Make sure 
the power of the product is turned off and wait more than one minute until disc rotation is 
stopped before accessing with the eject hole.

Caution:
Writable/printable discs are 12 cm (4.72”) CD/DVD discs. The 80 mm (3.15”) discs are not 
supported.


Note:
❏
Since the quality of any particular brand or type of disc may be changed by the manufacturer at 
any time, Epson cannot attest to the quality of any brand or type of disc. Always test samples 
of disc stock before purchasing large quantities or printing large jobs.


❏
Poor quality discs may reduce print quality and cause disc jams or other problems. If you 
encounter problems, switch to a higher grade of disc.


❏
The specified disc is for ink jet printers.


❏
The specified disc has a moisture adhesive ink receptor layer on the label surface. If stored 
stacked, especially under high humidity and high temperature conditions, discs may adhere to 
each other. If an automatic duplication machine is used, please check the disc before using.


❏
Please treat the recording surface (blue green colored side) and printing surface carefully so 
they do not have fingerprints, dirt, dust, water, or scratches. Dust and dirt on the recording 
surface should be wiped gently with soft dry cloth, commercially available disc cleaner, or ethyl 
alcohol. Do not use benzine, thinner, or antistatic material.

# Page 121

❏ Do not drop or hit discs.


❏ Do not apply excess force, like pinching with a clip, or bend.


❏ Do not attach an adhesive sticker to the disc. This may result in the disc being unable 
to record or play.


❏ Do not use in a place where lots of dirt and dust are present.


❏ If write and print are performed separately, it is recommended to write before printing.


❏ Leaving discs stacked may result in discs sticking to each other.


❏ Let the discs dry naturally after printing. Touching the surface with your hand or 
splashing the surface with water right after printing may result in blurriness and 
stickiness.


❏ Printing is possible only on the printing surface. When printing by hand, use a 
soft-tipped writing instrument like a felt pen, and do not use a ballpoint pen. Also, do not 
erase once printed.


❏ Do not use with an auto loading mechanism, a drive with a holding mechanism larger 
than 33 mm, or an automotive drive. Depending on the condition used, the printing 
surfaces may stick.


❏ A published CD/DVD may not be readable on another type of drive or player due to 
compatibility.


❏ The recording surface side has a concentric ring projection called the stack ring. 
Depending on the disc, projection of the stack ring is small and use of such a disc may 
cause the disc to stick before or after printing. It is recommended to check the disc 
before use. 


❏ The specified discs have a moisture-adhesive ink receptor layer on the label surface. If 
stored stacked, especially under high humidity and high temperature conditions, discs 
may adhere to each other. If an automatic duplication machine is used, please check 
the disc before using.


Notes when storing discs


❏ Do not store in direct sunlight, near heating equipment, or high humidity and 
temperature. 


❏ Do not place where large temperature variance takes place, as condensation may 
occur.


❏ Do not place an object on top of the disc. 


Product Information

# Page 122

❏ When storing, keep the disc in its disc case, and avoid letting film or cards touch the 
printing surface. These may scratch the printing surface.


❏ Do not store discs in soft cases or bags which may touch the printing surface directly. 
This may cause discs to stick; may cause color shading or discoloration.


❏ Avoid storing with part of the printing surface covered, as this may cause smearing or 
discoloration.


❏ Making a backup is recommended if the data is important. It is recommended to make 
backups periodically if storing for long period of time.


❏ Avoid storing in high temperatures and high humidity, which may result in blurriness 
and stickiness of the printing surface.

Caution:
❏
Make sure to set the inner diameter and the outer diameter within the areas shown above. 
Printing on sections outside the printable area may damage your CD/DVD drive.


❏
The EPSON Total Disc Maker can set between an inner diameter of 18 mm and an outer 
diameter of 119.4 mm (0.71 to 4.70"). However, printing outside the printable area (45 to 
116 mm) may result in sticking, staining of the disc tray, peeling of print, and blurring of 
print. It is recommended to check the disc type before using.


❏
When printing outside the printable area (ink absorbing layer) of the disc occurs, the ink 
printed outside the printable area does not fix. Check the label of the printable area of the 
disc being used before setting.


❏
Precautions for setting the printable area
-Make sure the printable area set does not exceed the printable area of the actual disc 
being used.
-Check whether coloration of print made on the rib (stack ring) is not uniform.
-Printing on the rib (stack ring) may cause ink sticking, disc sticking, and ink erasure after 
printing.


❏
Measures to be taken when printing outside printable area:
When printing inside the inner diameter results in ink sticking, disc sticking, and ink 
erasure, take the following action to avoid that.
-Set Drying Time on the printer driver’s printer settings screen and print. Although 
throughput may be reduced, problems will be avoided or reduced, since the disc will be 
ejected after a set time.
-Enable Publish after Mask Rib Area. If you print from another application, set from the 
user-defined label setting in the printer driver. If you print from the Total Disc Maker, set 
from Set Inner/Outer Diameter setting.


Note:
When you print on CDs/DVDs with a commercially available software package that supports 
CD/DVD printing, you have to make the following settings.

Caution:
❏
Epson recommends the use of genuine Epson ink cartridges. Other products not 
manufactured by Epson may cause damage that is not covered by Epson’s warranties, 
and under certain circumstances, may cause erratic behavior.


❏
Use the ink cartridge before the expiration date printed on its package.


❏
Do not refill the ink cartridge. Other products not manufactured by Epson may cause 
damage that is not covered by Epson's warranties, and under certain circumstances, may 
cause erratic behavior.


Note:
❏
The ink cartridges packaged with your product are partly used during initial setup. In order to 
produce high-quality printouts, the print head in your product will be fully charged with ink. This 
one-off process consumes a quantity of ink, and therefore these cartridges print fewer pages 
compared to subsequent ink cartridges.


❏
Do not store ink cartridges in high or freezing temperatures, or in direct sunlight.


❏
To ensure that you receive premium print quality and to help protect your print head, a variable 
ink safety reserve remains in the cartridge when your product indicates to replace the cartridge. 
The yields quoted for you do not include this reserve.


❏
Cartridge yields vary considerably based on images printed, print settings, disc type, frequency 
of use, and temperature. For print quality, a variable amount of ink remains in the cartridge after 
the "replace cartridge" indicator comes on. This product ships with full cartridges and part of the 
ink from the first cartridges is used for priming its printer. See www.discproducer.epson.com for 
more information about cartridges.


❏
Even when Black is selected, all the ink colors are used in an operation designed to maintain 
the printing and print head quality.
